# Image-Consistency
This repository contains a multi-step data science workflow for analyzing large-scale social media data. It spans data cleaning, statistical modeling, factor analysis, regression, and meta-analysis, with a final focus on comparing advanced count-based models such as zero-inflated negative binomial models.

### üìÅ Repository Structure
1_data_cleaning.ipynb
A Jupyter Notebook that handles data preprocessing and cleaning.

Analyses the images using a modified version of pyaesthetics

Removes duplicates, missing values, and inconsistencies

Normalizes and formats textual and numerical fields

Prepares the dataset for downstream statistical modeling in R

2_analysis_factor_regression_meta.Rmd
An R Markdown document that performs:

Descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis

Factor analysis to identify latent constructs in the dataset

Linear and generalized regression models to evaluate relationships

Meta-analysis combining insights across platforms or studies

3_model_comparison.Rmd
A second R Markdown file comparing several models suitable for social media engagement data, particularly skewed and zero-heavy outcomes.
Models evaluated include:

Poisson regression

Negative binomial regression

Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP)

Zero-inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB)

Model performance is assessed using AIC, BIC, and residual diagnostics

### üîß Requirements
Python: pandas, numpy, tqdm (for cleaning notebook)

R: tidyverse, psych, lavaan, metafor, pscl, MASS, and knitr for rendering

Make sure to install the required packages in both environments.

### üìå Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook to clean and export your dataset.

Open 2_analysis_factor_regression_meta.Rmd in RStudio to run the analysis pipeline.

Open 3_model_comparison.Rmd to evaluate and compare modeling strategies.
